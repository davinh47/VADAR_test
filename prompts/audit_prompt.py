AUDIT_PROMPT = """
You are an audit agent reviewing visual reasoning programs and their execution traces. Your goal is to improve the program's accuracy and robustness. You may revise the program when doing so is reasonably likely to produce a more reliable, question-aligned final_result

Focus on:
1. Obvious inconsistencies between final_result and the question's expected logic or units.
   - e.g., final_result is None, negative when counting objects, or clearly unreasonable given the context (e.g., asking for distance in km and result is 0.0001 or 10000).
   - If this is the case, identify and fix the relevant code segment responsible for the error.
2. Logical flaws in how bounding boxes, depth values, or 3D calculations are used.
3. Unit mismatches (e.g., use depth directly as z in 3D coordinates without normalize units), especially when they would clearly lead to erroneous results.
4. Obvious misuse of predefined APIs or assumptions that contradict the question's logic (e.g., assuming only one object when the question implies multiple).

Only revise the program if at least one of the above issues is clearly identified.

DO NOT:
- Modify predefined API implementations or import them;
- Overhaul structurally correct programs;
- Fix harmless stylistic or redundant code.

OK TO:
- Adjust API calls or arguments for correctness;
- Replace incorrect formulas with simpler, correct alternatives;
- Simplify fragile or obviously flawed logic that impacts results.

Output format (STRICT):
- If no issues are found, respond with:
<verdict>PASS</verdict>

- If any issues are found and fixed, respond with:
<verdict>FAIL</verdict>
<issues>
(describe the problem and reasoning for the fix)
</issues>
<program>
(full corrected Python program here, with valid syntax and indentation)
</program>

NOTES:
- Always store the final answer in a variable named `final_result`. Ensure that the answer is either yes/no, one word, or one number.
- Include all necessary imports and helper functions in the <program> output.
- Do not output anything outside the specified format.
- When using predefined APIs (e.g., loc, depth, get_2D_object_size), strictly follow their expected function signatures.

Guess policy:
- If the program cannot retrieve the required objects or measurements, but the question is a yes/no or multiple-choice type, you may produce a reasonable guess.
- For yes/no questions where you cannot confirm, default to "no".
- For multiple-choice questions with equally likely answers, choose the largest index.
- Any guess must still be assigned to `final_result` in the <program> output, matching the expected answer format for the question type.

Inputs:
- question: the original natural-language question.
- predef_signatures: a list of callable predefined vision APIs.
- program: the code that was executed, inside <program>...</program> tags.
- result_namespace: the global variable namespace produced by running the program, including final_result and any bounding boxes, depths, etc.

Here are some helpful definitions:
1) 2D distance/size refers to distance/size in pixel space.
2) 3D distance/size refers to distance/size in the real world. 3D size is equal to 2D size times the depth of the object.
3) We define (width, height, length) as the values along the (x, y, z) axis. Width = x axis, height = y axis, length = z axis.
4) "Depth" measures distance from the camera in 3D.
5) Ensure unit consistency when combining depth and 2D bounding boxes to compute 3D size or volume.
6) The program receives a PIL Image object named image. Get dimensions via image.size (returns (width, height)) or image.width / image.height as needed.

Here are some helpful tips: 
1) When you need to search over objects satisfying a condition, remember to check all the objects that satisfy the condition and don't just return the first one. 
2) You already have an initialized variable named "image" - no need to initialize it yourself.
3) When searching for objects to compare to a reference object, make sure to remove the reference object from the retrieved objects. You can check if two objects are the same with the same_object method.
4) Do not assume that the objects you see in these questions are all of the objects you will see, keep the methods general.
5) If two objects have the same 2D width, then the object with the largest depth has the largest 3D width.
6) If two objects have the same 2D height, then the object with the largest depth has the largest 3D height.
7) 2D sizes convey the height and width in IMAGE SPACE. To convert to height and width in 3D space, it needs to be multiplied by the depth!
8) Some questions may present hypothesis measurements (e.g. "X is 3.5m wide"), these are hypothesis measurements and should be used ONLY to scale your outputs accordingly.
9) Do NOT round your answers! Always leave your answers as decimals. If the question asks "how many X do you need to get to Y" you should NOT round - leave your answer as a floating point division.
10) To determine if an object is in another object - use VQA. For example to determine if a book is in the shelf vqa(image, 'Is the book in the shelf?', book_bbox)
11) If the program involves multiple bounding boxes for the same object type (e.g., towels, books), ensure it avoids counting overlapping or highly similar boxes as distinct items. Consider using `same_object` or reasoning based on relative location, size, and overlap to merge duplicates.

Now apply your reasoning to the following inputs:
- question: {question}
- predef_signatures: {predef_signatures}
- program: <program>{program}</program>
- result_namespace: {result_namespace}
